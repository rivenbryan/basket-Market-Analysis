# Basket Market Analysis
A data science project that uses Apriori Algorithm to generate insights for an E-commerce store

This is our groups data science project. It is on Market Basket Analysis for an E-commerce Store.

In summary, this project is about recommendation of products in order to increases sales and revenue of the e-commerce store.
But through the EDA process, we managed to discover more interesting sub questions which are about Customer Segmentation and Idea on Inventory Management. 
Through this project we were able to practically suggest products for a customer to purchase after purchasing his/her intended product.

To run the entire project, upload these 3 data files:
data.csv
b_customers_data_transactions.csv
s_customers_data_transactions.csv
s_ml_data.csv
b_ml_data.csv

Since the data filed are too big to be uploaded into github, we have uploaded it onto shared folder.
